# buddyfinder
You'd love to visit a contemporary art exposition but your better half is more of a renaissance person? Your friends ride mountain bikes you're a roadi? You're an erasmus student and tired to eat alone? Maybe your tennis buddy is sick and the already court is reserved... No matter the reason really, buddyfinder is here to help. Buddyfinder is meant for any spontaneous extracurricular activities. Simply name the activity, location and time and find people to share it with. All you need to get started is a valid unibe, unifr or unine e-mail address and off you go!

In the first version, we will most certainly build the whole activity creation, sharing and inviting/joining part. As well as the authentication and authorization for uni-be, fr, ne addresses. We also plan to build a responsive GUI such that it can be used on any screen.

If time allows we will add some extra features such as uploading pictures from the activities to create a Uni-Recreational album, commenting, link with other social networks, etc... We will see along the way which makes the most sense and what time allows us to do. 

Technology wise we are only bound to Node.Js and GitHub sofar. Considering the application we plan to build a no-SQL DB will be most appropriate, we haven't chosen which one we will use yet. We will deploy our app on a PAAS, but here again, we haven't made a choice at this stage of the project.
